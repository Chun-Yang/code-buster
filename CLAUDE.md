## Description
This is a web app to help kids to learn encoding and decoding written morse code, and atbash.
This is a mobile first app. If the screen width is too large, we limit it to 64rem.
Don't use fixed position in css.

## Tech stack
- react
- router: wouter with hash based routing
- typescript
- no server, no login, a pure client app

## TODO
Implement similar /atbash-config, /atbash-exercise, /atbash-rate for atbash similar to morse code
